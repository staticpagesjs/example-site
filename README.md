# StaticPages example repository

This project is a quick demo setup to present some of the basic concepts behind the [StaticPages](https://staticpagesjs.github.io) project.

## Directory structure

- `messages` contains the i18n translation bags.
- `pages` contains the source materials.
- `public` contains the output HTML pages.
- `scripts` contains the `build`, `watch` etc. lifecycle scripts.
- `views` is where template files are loaded from.
- `static` groups all the static assets which are copied at build time to output.

## Building the samples

Run `npm install` then `npm run build`.
